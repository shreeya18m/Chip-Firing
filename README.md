# Chip-Firing
This repository contains code related to chip-firing for my bachelor's thesis project.
The file "Labelled chip-firing on N" contains code for configuration and firing poset for the labelled chip-firing process on the infinite-path graph on natural numbers starting with all n chips at some vertex r
The file "Labelled chip-firing on Z starting with 2 stacks contains code for configuration and firing poset for the labelled chip-firing process on the infinite-path graph on integers starting with all m and n chips at vertices p and q respectively. It also contains code for obtained the gap vertices and the length of contiguous pieces in the stabilisation.
